    abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is often used to describe the automation of complex tasks that we would attribute intelligence to. Machine learning (ML) is commonly understood as a set of methods used to develop an AI. Both have seen a recent boom in usage, both in scientific and commercial fields. For the scientific community, ML can solve bottle necks created by complex, multi-dimensional data generated, for example, by functional brain imaging or *omics approaches. ML can here identify patterns that could not have been found using traditional statistic approaches. However, ML comes with serious limitations that need to be kept in mind: their tendency to optimise solutions for the input data means it is of crucial importance to externally validate any findings before considering them more than a hypothesis. Their black-box nature implies that their decisions usually cannot be understood, which renders their use in medical decision making problematic and can lead to ethical issues. Here, we present an introduction for the curious to the field of ML/AI. We explain the principles as commonly used methods as well as recent methodological advancements before we discuss risks and what we see as future directions of the field. Finally, we show practical examples of neuroscience to illustrate the use and limitations of ML.}

abstract = {Clinical observations suggest that bilateral damage of the hippocampal region and fornix may result in severe disturbances of recent memory. Experiments were undertaken to determine whether hippocampal and fornical lesions in rats have deleterious effects on maze learning and retention. A fourteen-choice mutiple-T alley maze was employed. The effect on postoperative initial learning was studied in fifty-two rats. One group of animals sustained bilateral and another group unilateral hippocampal or fornical lesions. A third group served as operated controls and received lesions in the same neocortical areas as the hippocampectomized animals. A fourth group of one hundred four rats were used as nonoperated normal controls. The animals with hippocampal or fornical lesions showed a significantly defective maze learning compared with the operated and nonoperated controls in terms of total errors and time required to run the maze. Deficit in maze performance also followed removal of the mamillary bodies. Thirty-eight rats were used in retention experiments and sustained either bilateral or unilateral hippocampal lesions, or removals of the neocortex overlying the hippocampus. All animals in this series were incompletely trained preoperatively and retrained postoperatively. The hippocampectomized rats suffered significant impairment in maze retention and relearning compared with the operated controls. It was concluded that lesions of the hippocampus, fornix, and mamillary bodies seem to interfere with maze learning and retention, when incompletely trained preoperatively. The data obtained do not allow any conclusions as to how these structures are involved in learning and retention, neither as to their relative importance compared with other brain structures like neocortex or thalamus, both of which are previously known to influence learning and retention.}

	abstract = {Structural MRIs of the brains of humans with extensive navigation experience, licensed London taxi drivers, were analyzed and compared with those of control subjects who did not drive taxis. The posterior hippocampi of taxi drivers were significantly larger relative to those of control subjects. A more anterior hippocampal region was larger in control subjects than in taxi drivers. Hippocampal volume correlated with the amount of time spent as a taxi driver (positively in the posterior and negatively in the anterior hippocampus). These data are in accordance with the idea that the posterior hippocampus stores a spatial representation of the environment and can expand regionally to accommodate elaboration of this representation in people with a high dependence on navigational skills. It seems that there is a capacity for local plastic change in the structure of the healthy adult human brain in response to environmental demands.},

To determine how information about location, direction, and distance is integrated in the grid-cell network, we recorded from each principal cell layer of MEC in rats that explored two-dimensional environments. Whereas layer II was predominated by grid cells, grid cells colocalized with head-direction cells and conjunctive grid Ã— head-direction cells in the deeper layers. All cell types were modulated by running speed. The conjunction of positional, directional, and translational information in a single MEC cell type may enable grid coordinates to be updated during self-motionâ€“based navigation.},
