Neural networks have found many areas of use, and its use only increases as computational resources increase. Several companies have set up farms of servers around the world to distribute the use of energy. Recently, Google announced that they are building a new data center in Skien in Norway. 

In neuroscience, it is possible to use machine learning to test many hypotheses, before continuing with the most relevant in animal models. This can speed up the time of testing while reducing the number of animal lives spent.

It is however, important to build efficient models, as the energy resources are still limited. 

The goal of basic research in neuroscience, is to understand how the brain works. As the brain is made up of three main parts - the cerebrum, cerebellum and brainstem. Many advances have been made, based on people suffering from injuries. Such as Phineas Gage who survived an iron rod through his skull, which damaged his frontal lobe. A change in Gage's behavior led scientists to understand the function of the frontal lobe in humans...

Throughout history, several psychiatric treatments have been important in understanding the human brain. However, knowing the function of the main areas of the brain, is not enough in understanding the brain as a whole. Moving down to a molecular level, we still have a lot to learn. 

As the artificial neural network was inspired by the synapses in the brain, it has been found useful in neuroscience. Using biological plausible conditions. One interesting circuit to investigate, is the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit. 

Path integration in neural networks is a time dependent process, which can be solved using recurrent neural networks.
